# FinalProject_COGS18_WI22
Final project for Cogs 18 course

So, for my project, I chose to make a game that needs both skill and luckiness. Here are the illustration:
#**
***
***
As you can see, this game is constructed of * and #
For this game, you need to fulfill all the spaces with all #
In the game, you are asked to enter the row and column, you could only choose the postion that has '#'
Then, the space around '#' will become '#' and itself will become *
For instance:
#*
**
will become
*#
#*
So, in this game, you can only click on '#' and the goal is to make '#'
all the space, and the last '#' you click would not become '*
Last sentence would mean that:
*#
#* 
if you choose to enter the row 1 and column 2
then it will become
##
##
so it will not change to '*' if it is the last move

The reason that I chose to make this game is because I was inspired by the Artificial Agents assignment. As we were asked to design several moving symbols on a map, I got to think why not make a game that fulfills the map; then, I came up with this idea. Moreover, I think everyone who plays this game would learn to think slowly as it is very easy to get stuck in my game (ha-ha). Nevermind, this is the same in learning python. We just need to learn step by step and then we could all achieve our goals.
