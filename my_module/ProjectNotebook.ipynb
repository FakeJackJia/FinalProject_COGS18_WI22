    "##\n",
    "so it will not change to '*' if it is the last move\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that I chose to make this game is because I was inspired by the Artificial Agents assignment. As we were asked to design several moving symbols on a map, I got to think why not make a game that fulfills the map; then, I came up with this idea. Moreover, I think everyone who plays this game would learn to think slowly as it is very easy to get stuck in my game (ha-ha). Nevermind, this is the same in learning python. We just need to learn step by step and then we could all achieve our goals. "

For instance, I have used recursion and two-dimenstional array in achieving my goal. I think the most crucial thing I learnt from my final project are comments and tests. To be honest, in the past, I was lazy to write these two aspects in my code; however, these two concepts really help me organize my code and let me to know which area to debug."
